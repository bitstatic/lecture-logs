# lecture-logs

## Purpose
This is an android app build on java whose purpose is to make the Lecture-timetable for everyone at JUET more accessible instead of the hefty and unorganised PDF that is distributed every semester.

## Utility
This project used n-D array to store and display the Time table which initially has to be fed into the system. The clever Way for this was to write a c++ script which takes the input of what the Data is and returns the text that we need to paste inside out Java code.
The script can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/sukumar1210/Lecture-Logs-Script).
